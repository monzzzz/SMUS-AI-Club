By\\nKent Leahy-Trill\\n-\\nJune 19, 2023 Tags: Share: We are incredibly proud to celebrate the graduating Class of 2023, and recognize their accomplishment in reaching this milestone moment. Our 151-member grad class is a group of exceptional young people and role models who are about to embark on the next stage of their lives \\u2013 and we could not be more excited to see what the next chapter brings for them. For many students in the Class of 2023, much of their time at theSenior Schoolincluded the COVID pandemic. They overcame the hurdles that this presented, and have come out the other side as resilient leaders. During the graduation ceremony, Head of School Mark Turner commented, \\\"There is a curse of uncertain origin, \\\"May you live in interesting times\\\". The times you, young leaders, are inheriting, are most certainly interesting. There's no doubt that tomorrow we will need leaders of talent, compassion, integrity, and vision. Take hope and optimism in the fact that there are many here tonight.\\\" These students of eighteen nationalities will head off to a wide variety of schools and countries near and far next year. One-hundred-twelve grads will stay in Canada, studying at eighteen different schools, while another seventeen students will study at sixteen American schools. Thirteen students will attend schools internationally in the UK, and a further ten students will be attending institutions in Australia, Asia, and the European Union. Four students will take a gap year to work, travel and take a year of discovery before embarking on their post-secondary pathway. Below are excerpts from valedictorian Daniel Benjamin's speech, which you can watch in full as part of the Grade 12 Graduation Ceremony video at the bottom of this story. Browse and download photos from the Grade 12 Graduation Ceremony on theSMUS Photo Gallery. Photos of members of the Class of 2023 on stage can be found by typing their full name (eg. Daniel Benjamin) into the \\\"simple search\\\" bar. Valedictory Address (excerpts) Thank you to my classmates for electing me as valedictorian. I may not have won the coveted head prefect position, but I knew that eventually, my incredibly handsome face would win you guys over.Graduation is not only a time to reflect back on the fun and wonderful memories we have made and what we have achieved, but also a time to look to what the future holds. With the risk of sounding clich\\u00e9, I\\u2019d like to offer some advice. We stand here today on the brink of a significant transition, far larger than simply fromJunior Schoolto Middle School orMiddle Schoolto Senior School. After sharing up to 13 years together, we are finally going our separate ways. It\\u2019s evidently a bittersweet moment, which I\\u2019m sure will cause some tearful goodbyes, but this moment holds the possibility to be a key turning point in our lives.As we go out into the world, with the goal of making a difference in our own unique way, we can look at this transition as an opportunity to accept and address the mistakes and regrets we may have had throughout our lives up to this point, whether it be in terms of school, personal relationships with family and friends, or in our own morals and qualities. Let go of these past regrets, but do not let go of the lessons you learned from them.Between the already established social setting and comfortable familiarity of our actions, it can be difficult to take the time and courage to reflect on what we want for ourselves and actually commit to achieving it. The weight of expectations from others can also make it hard for us to identify who we truly want to be. Moving on from high school gives us all a chance to take that difficult step forward without worrying about the familiarity of ingrained routines and what other people think of us. While it may seem that we already have firmly ingrained identities, we are actually still in the process of forming them.I want to recognize that while it is important to stay true to our values, don\\u2019t be afraid to inspect your ideals and search for ways in which you can aspire to be better. This is not an invitation to compromise your morals and beliefs simply for the sake of conformity with others\\u2019 ideas or in response to peer pressure, but an entreaty to look inward and think about who you are, and what you want. The American poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emmerson said that \\u201cto be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to change you is the greatest accomplishment.\\u201d\\u00a0 Look at these forks in the road, where you have the choice between a path often travelled which may not perfectly align with your ideals, or the option to forge one of your own, as tests of your character, and do not give in.In our years together atSMUS, we have acquired a solid foundation, and we must build upon it. I hope that when we come back together for our class reunion, each and every one of us can talk with pride of what we have accomplished.I\\u2019d like to end with a final congratulation to our class of 2023. We did it! Tags: Kent Leahy-Trill Kent Leahy-Trill is Web Manager at St. Michaels University School.

Before my current association with SMUS, I remember being swayed at a dinner party by friends who insisted I had to visit the Junior School and feel its charm and energy for myself. Being a person who likes to explore at her own pace, I opted for an Open House visit rather than an appointment. The energy and level of curiosity by the young students was on clear display and I was won over. My son, of course, initially wanted none of it then but before long and nine years later, he was thanking his teachers more profusely than his parents. I knew I had made the right choice. Our Fall Spark Open House is Friday, October 25 and again we're throwing our doors open at our Junior, Middle and Senior Schools so that other parents can have the same experience I did. While ostensibly Open House is for future families, we also want current parents who have a child moving into Grade 6 or Grade 9 next year to please consider visiting us during Open House to see what awaits them. As well, should you find yourself at a dinner party, perhaps there will be a guest or two ready to be swayed to look at SMUS. As we say, \\\"bring a friend!\\\" Here\\u2019s some of what is in store: For more information and to register, please visit the SMUS Fall Spark Open House webpage.

Susanne was honoured with the esteemed accolade during the 2023 CSSRA Championships held in St. Catharines, Ontario.Award recipients must have served high school rowing for at least 25 years. Susanne surpassed that mark through her 11 years at Brentwood College School and 17 years atSt. Michaels University School. Nevertheless, the essential prerequisite for Susanne was the need to have contributed to high school rowing by creating innovative, influential, and motivational initiatives. As Head of the SMUS rowing program, Susanne is known for her ability to develop well-rounded individuals and prepare them for the challenges of life in general, not just in sports. Just one of the highlights of Susanne’s commitment in recent years was the program she ran during COVID. When COVID first resulted in students being sent home, she implemented virtual fitness training sessions. Despite the time differences around the world, she had athletes from across Canada and the United States, England, Germany and Hong Kong who continued to participate as part of the team, despite some of them knowing they would never have the opportunity to row again for SMUS. Even when classes began but restrictions still applied for sports, Susanne moved the dryland training outdoors so athletes could continue their training while respecting the COVID restrictions. Firinne Rolfe ‘21 was offered multiple scholarship opportunities when she graduated. She credits Susanne with promoting healthy competitiveness and a love of hard work. She said Susanne always believed in her and pushed her to be the best version of herself. “She has always believed I could achieve things before I have had the confidence to believe it myself.”This sentiment was echoed by Nathan Yang ‘20 who noted “She believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself.” He said that Susanne, through her critical yet compassionate approach to every athlete in the program, had an incredible impact on his life and development as a student, athlete and human being. Parents of athletes in the rowing program have observed the impact Susanne has had on their children. Dan Sheehan noted that Susanne’s “ability to transform kids from non-athletes to Canadian champions is truly miraculous. It is through her inspirational teaching methods and her true love for each and every member of her team and fellow coaches that she is able to create transformative change.” The life lessons learned from Susanne will carry these young people long into the future. Martin McElroy, who was not only a parent but also an Olympic Gold medal rowing coach, understands the demands and stress of the job. According to Martin, being a professional coach was relatively easy when compared with running a program in a school environment, balancing the demands of school, academic and sporting life, and maintaining a position as a teacher. Martin said he helped with coaching whenever he was able, but he felt the SMUS rowing program may have helped him more than he helped the program. “Watching young athletes have fun, seeing them develop as individuals, and see them come together selflessly for the team was a reaffirmation of the power of sport to me. There is no question that the hub and source of the energy that propels the SMUS rowing program comes from Susanne.” Sarah Hagkull ‘16, current SMUS rowing Assistant Coach, credits Susanne’s empowering mindset and leadership with bringing her to the position and profile she currently has at the school, and in life in general. She reflected on how she learned that whether sitting at the starting line, crossing the finish line or walking through the hotel lobby, she represented the school, team, families, and coaches, as well as herself. Susanne’s passion for the rowing program and her athletes is evident in both the program and her rowers. She has not hesitated to bring in other professionals to support the athlete development, including a former athlete who now has a career in Los Angeles, to host an online scavenger hunt on campus for team members. The athletes were having so much fun they didn’t recognize the teambuilding and fitness aspect of the activities until the event was finished. Susanne also engaged a sport psychology professional to support the athlete's development. In these cases, the individuals donated their talents and time out of respect for Susanne. That respect and passion is evident even at the local regattas where SMUS rowing alumni returning from university regularly volunteer their services to help at major regattas and encourage current team members. Nathan Yang ‘20 summed it up best when he said “She is much more than just a rowing coach; she is a teacher, leader, mentor, and most of all – family. One team, one family.” Tags: Greg Gilks  You might also be interested in Athletics Athletics NEWS - September 23, 2024 Athletics Week in Review: September 23, 2024 Athletics Athletics NEWS - September 19, 2024 SMUS Senior Boys Volleyball: Team Gears Up for Intense Season with Playoff Ambitions Athletics Athletics NEWS - September 18, 2024 SMUS Senior Boys Soccer: Optimism and Experience Fuel Promising Season St. Michaels University School is an independent day and boarding school of 1,000 students from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 in Victoria, BC, Canada.

This is our first large-scale production since we ranNewsiesin March 2020 and we are thrilled to be back on stage. All 80-plus students involved should be immensely proud of their work, and I hope you have the chance to watch them make it happen!Also this week, our basketball program is proving it did not lose a step during the pandemic.

A few Old Boys have written memoirs, but I do not know of any who became prominent authors. One, Andrew Phillips, became a journalist and, ultimately, the editor of theMontreal Gazette. Reading I remember taking turns reading aloud in class from a text chosen by the master, and we received marks for this. There was also a reading competition in which junior and senior boys, in front of the whole school sitting in the gymnasium, read from a book placed on a lectern. No boy had previously seen the text, and each reader entered the gym in his turn, and so could not benefit from hearing the preceding readers. All boys in the three senior forms (Grades 7, 8 and 9) also read the lesson at Prayers in the gym every morning before the first class. The rota meant that each boy read in front of everyone about three times a year. Writing I thought it was unfair to have handwriting as a marked subject because it had nothing to do with one\\u2019s intelligence. My writing was OK, but some very smart boys received lower marks than others simply because their \\u2018hand,\\u2019 though perfectly legible, was not considered to be cursive enough.\"\n        ],\n

This is our first large-scale production since we ranNewsiesin March 2020 and we are thrilled to be back on stage. All 80-plus students involved should be immensely proud of their work, and I hope you have the chance to watch them make it happen!Also this week, our basketball program is proving it did not lose a step during the pandemic.

A few Old Boys have written memoirs, but I do not know of any who became prominent authors. One, Andrew Phillips, became a journalist and, ultimately, the editor of theMontreal Gazette. Reading I remember taking turns reading aloud in class from a text chosen by the master, and we received marks for this. There was also a reading competition in which junior and senior boys, in front of the whole school sitting in the gymnasium, read from a book placed on a lectern. No boy had previously seen the text, and each reader entered the gym in his turn, and so could not benefit from hearing the preceding readers. All boys in the three senior forms (Grades 7, 8 and 9) also read the lesson at Prayers in the gym every morning before the first class. The rota meant that each boy read in front of everyone about three times a year. Writing I thought it was unfair to have handwriting as a marked subject because it had nothing to do with one\\u2019s intelligence. My writing was OK, but some very smart boys received lower marks than others simply because their \\u2018hand,\\u2019 though perfectly legible, was not considered to be cursive enough.\"\n        ],\n
